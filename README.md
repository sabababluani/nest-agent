# 📂 FilesystemService - AI-Driven File System Agent (NestJS)

This `FilesystemService` class is a smart, NestJS-based file system manager that interprets natural language prompts and maps them to actual file system operations using the Gemini API. It includes support for reading, writing, listing, searching files, creating directories, and fetching Wi-Fi passwords (on Windows), while logging each action to a repository.
